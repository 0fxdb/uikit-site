# Less files

<p class="uk-text-lead">To build your own version of UIkit, including your custom styling, use the included Less files.</p>

Less is the language that the UIkit styles are written in. It needs to be compiled into CSS before it can be included on your page. This allows you to include any customizations in the build process, rather than manually overwriting a lot of CSS rules by hand.

***

## Install a package with Less sources

There are several packages of UIkit available, just make sure to grab one that includes the Less files if you want to use them in your project. This is the case for examp√ºle when using the Bower package or in the official Github source files. Head to the [installation guide](install.md) to choose your favorite option.

***

## Compile Github sources

To automate the process of compiling Less files into CSS, we use Node scripts to watch the source directory you are working on. Whenever you save changes in the source files, Node compiles all files into one single CSS file.

Go to the UIkit directory and install the Node dependencies. After that you can compile the Less files once or watch them while you are working on them.

```html
cd uikit
npm install

<!-- Run to compile once -->
npm run compile

<!-- Run to re-compile on every file change -->
npm run watch
```

***

## Compile from Bower package

When you have installed UIkit through Bower, all Less sources are located in a subfolder. To include the Building of UIkit in your project's own build workflow, you need to import the central `uikit.less` file inside your project's own Less file. For example, just include UIkit and additional components at the top of your main Less file and start customizing by utilizing UIkit's hooks and override its variables. This main Less file then needs to be compiled in any way you like. Read the [official Less docs](http://lesscss.org/usage/) if you are unsure how to compile Less.

```
// Import UIkit core
@import "bower_components/uikit/src/less/uikit.less";

// Your custom code goes here, e.g. mixins, variables
```

## Build a UIkit theme

If you have chosen option 1 and installed the complete UIkit sources, you can use the included build files and add your own custom theme. You can start by copying the included example theme or by creating your own theme from scratch. If you have chosen option 2 and installed the Bower package, you can setup your own file structure because you are simply importing UIkit in your own project.

Inside the UIkit folder, create a `/custom` directory, which will contain all of your custom themes.

**Note** The `/custom` folder is listed in `.gitignore`, which prevents your custom files from being pushed into the UIkit repository. You might also have the `/custom` directory as your own Git repository. That way your theme files are under version control without interfering with the UIkit files.

Create a file `my-theme.less` (or any other name) in the `/custom` folder and add the following import to include all Less components from the core framework. In this file, you will overwrite Less variables and add your own theme styles.

```less
@import "../src/less/uikit.less";
```

Run the script `build/less.js` which will compile all themes in the `/custom` folder.

```sh
node build/less
```

The newly created themes will now be available in the test files, just navigate your browser to the index of the `/test` directory and select your theme from the Dropdown menu. The generated CSS files will be located in the `/css` folder.

### Optional: Start with the default theme

To get you started right away, we provide a default theme located in `/src/less/uikit.theme.less` which imports additional files from the `/src/less/theme` directory. This theme imports all default files and you will also find all theme files with their related hooks. So if you do not want to start empty, all you need to do is to duplicate this file and the `/src/less/theme` folder, move both into the `/custom` directory and rename them however you want.

## Best practices

There are different approaches to change the UIkit style when working with Less. We recommend the following workflow. The included examples assume you are building a theme in the `/custom` directory of the full UIkit project. If you import the Less files into your own project, these examples are still valid, but you will need to adapt the file paths to your own setup.

### Use variables

The first thing to do is to customize the values of already declared variables. You can find all variables for each component inside their Less files of the core framework and override them in your theme. Many global values are defined in `src/less/variables.less`.


`/src/less/components/variables.less`

```less
// default value
@global-link-color: #4091D2;
```

`/custom/my-theme.less`

```less
// new value
@global-link-color: #DA7D02;
```

### Use hooks

To prevent overhead selectors, we use Mixins from [Less](http://lesscss.org), which hook into predefined selectors from the UIkit source and apply additional properties. Selectors don't have to be repeated throughout all documents and global changes can be made much more easily.

`/src/less/components/card.less`

```less
// CSS rule
.uk-card {
    position: relative;
    box-sizing: border-box;

    // mixin to allow adding new declarations
    .hook-card;
}
```


`/custom/my-theme.less`

```less
// mixin to add new declaration
.hook-card() { color: #000; }
```

### Miscellaneous hooks

Should there be neither a variable nor a hook available, you can of course create your own selector. To do so, use the _.hook-card-misc_ hook and write your selector inside. This will sort your new selector to the right place of the compiled CSS file.

`/custom/my-theme.less`

```less
// misc mixin
.hook-card-misc() {

    // new rule
    .uk-card a { color: #f00; }
}
```

### Multiple Less files

In the above examples, we have added all custom rules directly inside `/custom/my-theme.less`. When you simple change a few variables but are happy with the rest, this is perfectly fine. However, for more custom themes and larger projects, we recommend to only use this file as an entry point for the less compiler, but sort all rules into the according component files inside of a subfolder. This is the same structure that you can find in the default theme `/src/less/uikit.theme.less`.

```html
custom/

    <!-- entry file for Less compiler -->
    my-theme.less

    <!-- folder with single Less files -->
    my-theme/

        <!-- imports all components in this folder -->
        _import.less

        <!-- one file per customized component -->
        accordion.less
        alert.less
        ...
```

The entry point for the Less compiler, `/custom/my-theme.less`.

```less
// Core
@import "../../src/less/uikit.less";

// Theme
@import "my-theme/_import.less";
```

Your theme folder has one file which imports all single component customizations, `custom/my-theme/_import.less`.

```
@import "accordion.less";
@import "alert.less";
// ...
```
