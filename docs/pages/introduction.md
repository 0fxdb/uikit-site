# Get started

<p class="uk-text-lead">Get familiar with the basic setup and overview of UIkit.</p>

First of all you need to download UIkit. For other packages and links to a CDN, head to the [installation guide](install.md) to learn more.

## Package contents

The Zip file contains the compiled CSS and JavaScript files, which is everything you need to get started. Later, you might want to [install and compile UIkit](install.md) yourself and also [create your own UIkit theme](theme.md).

| Folder    | Description |
| --------- | --- |
| `/css`    | Contains all UIkit CSS files and minified versions. |
| `/images` | Contains all the images used within UIkit (e.g. icons) |
| `/js`     | Contains all UIkit JavaScript files and minified versions. |

## HTML markup

First off, make sure you have a solid code editor, for example [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/). You need to add the compiled and preferably minified UIkit CSS and JavaScript to the header of your HTML5 document. [jQuery](http://jquery.com/download/) is required as well. For your basic setup, that's it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/uikit.min.css" />
        <script src="js/jquery.js"></script> <!-- download from jquery.com -->
        <script src="js/uikit.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

Once you have finished implementing UIkit into your webpage, take a look at the UIkit components and get an overview of what UIkit is offering.

## UIkit autocomplete for  your editor

To work even more efficiently, we recommend that you install one of the autocomplete plugins for your favourite IDE or code editor. This saves loads of time, as you won't have to look up and type all UIkit classes and markup.

We'll update this section as soon as these plugins are available.
