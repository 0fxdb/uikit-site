# Get started

<p class="uk-text-lead">Get familiar with the basic setup and overview of UIkit.</p>

## Installation

There are several packages of UIkit available and multiple ways to install it - all of them easy and straight forward. Head to the [installation guide](install.md) to choose your favorite option and grab your copy of the UIkit files.

***

## HTML markup

First off, make sure you have a solid code editor, for example [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/). You need to add the compiled and preferably minified UIkit CSS and JavaScript to the header of your HTML5 document. jQuery is required as well. For your basic setup, that's it.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="uikit.min.css" />
        <script src="jquery.js"></script>
        <script src="uikit.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

Once you have finished implementing UIkit into your webpage, take a look at the UIkit components and get an overview of what UIkit is offering.

## UIkit autocomplete for IDEs

To work even more efficiently, we recommend that you install one of the autocomplete plugins for your favourite IDE or code editor. This saves loads of time, as you won't have to look up and type all UIkit classes and markup.

We'll update this section as soon as these plugins are available.
